we should be very much aware of the fact that people take time
implementing the code due to the errors they face;
we have many attributes in our classes
if we forget to intiale them
we might end up with the null pointer exception down the line;
So ensure that all the attributes are initialized to something if we thing

there are two ways to handle it:

1=> and the ways is create constructor in every class and initiale the attributes


All the classes are se i.e we have created the constructors and initialed the attributes
So start thinking of the user flow

This is a interactive desktop application so the main class should make the whole application run
so create a main class. Lets call it as TicTacToeGame class.
